# Goals of the Fellowship

Our long-term, overarching, unifying goal is to see more of this type
of work happen in the world, and for our fellows to leave the program
better equipped and more likely to use their skills for social good.

To achieve this, our program focuses on three guiding
goals. Our goals are (in order of priority):

1. [Training Our Fellows](#training-our-fellows)
2. [Increasing the responsible use of Data Science/ML/AI in Social Good Organizations](#introducing-data-science-to-the-social-sector)
3. [Building and Supporting a Community of Data Scientists for Social Good](#building-a-community-of-data-scientists-for-social-good)
4. [Tackling and Making an Impact on the Problems We Work on]

We know that these goals are lofty. We do not presume or pretend to
know the optimal way to achieve them, but we believe it's worth
trying. We want all of you to help us by actively contributing ideas
to improve our program and achieve these goals more effectively.

### Training Our Fellows
**First and foremost, DSSG is a training program for fellows.** We
believe that the best way to learn is by working on real projects and
not toy examples, which is why fellows work on *real projects* with
*real partners*, in teams with other *real people*. The program
provides training in the form of hands-on technical data science
experience, but that’s not enough to do real data science for social
good. The training aspect of the fellowship also includes working with
project partners, understanding social issues, using social science
methods, working collaboratively on a team, developing solutions in an
agile way, and communicating effectively to technical and
non-technical audiences.

We start off with a week of intensive orientation, getting everyone
acquainted with each other and the structure of the program, as well
as making sure all the fellows are up to speed with the tools and
methods that are fellowship-wide standards. Training continues
throughout the summer with lectures and workshops by staff, guest
speakers, and fellow teach-outs. Dedicated full-time data science
mentors and project managers will support and guide fellows throughout
the summer.

In short, we want the summer to be a productive and collaborative
experience for you, and will provide you with many resources; however,
**your biggest resource will be yourself and the other fellows in your
cohort**. Every fellow contributes their own wealth of experience and
expertise, and we aim to foster a learning environment where everyone
can share this knowledge and learn from one another.

### Increasing the use of Responsible Data Science in Social Good Organizations
We believe that data-driven decisionmaking isn’t reserved for
companies selling online advertisements or banks trying to detect
fraud. We know that data science can help governments, non-profits,
and social good organizations do their work more effectively and serve their constituents more equitably.

All of our project partners collect data, and many are already using
data in some way, whether to evaluate their programs and write reports
for their funders. However, most social good organizations have not
used data science to actively inform their ongoing decision
processes. Through this program, we aim to increase awareness of the
benefits and challenges of data-driven impact work, both among the
partners we work with and among non-profits and governments in
general.

**Our project partners are partners, not clients.** This means that
the fellows work *with* the partners, not *for* them. We believe that
participating in this program helps both the partners and the fellows
develop a common language and learn how to work together more effectively. Sometimes fellows and partners won't see
eye to eye on every decision, or the need to complete work within a
deadline will mean you have to adjust your expectations, put
[GNU/Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)[^1] on the back burner, or sacrifice
doing the work exactly the way you had hoped. While fellows' learning
is our primary priority, it is important to note that part of what
fellows are learning is how to work with partners to produce work that
is useful for the partners and delivered on time.

### Building and Supporting a Community of Data Scientists for Social Good
**We hope -- and expect -- that your impact as a DSSG alum continues
beyond your summer tenure.** Throughout the summer, we will introduce
you to other practitioners within the data science and social good
spaces to help you understand these sectors, form relationships, and
start to think about potential contributions you could make. You’ll
also have the opportunity to network with local data science, tech,
government, non-profit, and startup communities through regular
fellowship-sponsored happy hours and meetups.

Whether it’s continuing to collaborate with your DSSG colleagues on
other social good projects, joining the data team at a government
agency, or working to recruit other like-minded people to apply their
in-demand data science skills to impactful problems, we hope that this
is just the beginning of of a lifetime as a data scientist for social
good.

# Our Hopes for Your Fellowship Experience

The fellowship provides you with the opportunity to learn; to work on
important, challenging, and unique projects; and to meet a lot of
people who share your interests and goals. It is up to you to take
advantage of these opportunities.

We hope you use the summer to:

* Meet a group of fellows, staff and project partners who have a
  wealth of skills and experiences; listen to and learn from them; and
  make new friends.
* Embrace gaps in your knowledge as learning opportunities, exploring
  your limitations with respect to technical skills, new methods from
  different disciplines, project management, social issues, and
  teamwork.
* Learn about the challenges of working on real projects that don’t
  have clean data, guaranteed results, or elegant solutions.
* Navigate the triangle between learning technical skills, creating
  deliverables that are useful and actionable for your project
  partner, and putting the varied skills within your team to good
  use.
* Rise to the challenge of working on a team that will include strong
  personalities with diverse experiences and strengths
* Realize the ambiguity and uncertainty that comes with working in a
  traditionally less tech-savvy sector, and learn how to communicate
  effectively to bridge this gap.
* Explore the impact (intentional and unintentional) that working with
  data from real, often disadvantaged or marginalized, people might
  have on them.
* Think deeply about the scope and limitations of technology to
  improve social problems.
* Explore existing roles in the field of data science for social good,
  find one you are best suited for, or create your own.

!!! note
    **Throughout the summer, we encourage you to share your ideas about
    how to improve the fellowship experience for yourself and others --
    and to put them into action.** We are constantly trying to improve the
    fellowship every day throughout the summer, and over time as we learn
    from each cohort.

# Our Expectations of Fellows

The fellowship offers a lot of freedom; however, we expect all fellows
to stick to the basic principles of conduct listed below at all
times. These guidelines apply to everybody at the fellowship,
including mentors, project managers, and the fellowship
organizers. *If you feel that anyone is not behaving in accordance
with these guidelines, we invite you to bring it up constructively. If
you are unsure who to address, or if you do not feel comfortable doing
so directly, you can bring up your concerns with the fellow advocate.*

* **Be supportive, open-minded, and willing to compromise.** DSSG
  brings together people from different backgrounds and with different
  skills. In fact, this might be the best resource the fellowship has
  to offer! Share your knowledge and your experience with each
  other. Be patient as you teach each other, and have an open ear for
  your peers.

* **Be professional.** You will be working with NGOs, non-profits, and
  government institutions as project partners. You will also be
  presenting your work at and attending events with the general
  public. In all of these capacities you are acting as a
  representative of the DSSG community. We expect you to be
  professional — that is, respectful, friendly, and on time — in your
  conduct with partners and the public alike.

* **Be resourceful and pragmatic.** Own your own learning. Seek out
  resources as necessary. Don't be shy to ask others for help, but be
  mindful of their time - tell them what what you do understand, where
  you're stuck, and what you’ve already tried, so they know how they
  can help. When you notice problems or have ideas for improvements —
  be it in your team, your project, or the fellowship — don’t rely on
  others to notice or fix them; offer your initiative.

* **Deal with conflicts maturely.** There are many potential sources
  of conflict throughout the fellowship. It is perfectly acceptable,
  and even expected, that you will run into conflicts with your team,
  your mentors, your project, or the fellowship organizers. In any
  case, we ask you to be productive, pragmatic, and mature when
  dealing with conflicts. Keep an open mind, listen and communicate
  with everybody involved.  Neither your project, nor your team, nor
  the fellowship will be perfect. Remember that everyone involved has
  invested a lot in the fellowship and wants all participants to be
  happy.

* **Show up.** We have all committed to be here for the duration of
  the program. The fellowship runs from approximately from end of May
  through the end of August[^2] . We
  expect you to
  be in the office five days a week, to attend all DSSG-wide sessions,
  occasional special events, and the final event. We recognize that
  you have a life outside of the fellowship, and *if you have any
  known or potential absences, you must inform DSSG staff upon your
  acceptance.* Any additional conflicts that arise during the summer
  must be discussed with and agreed between you, your team, and your
  project manager well ahead of time.

* **Take care of the space.** Offices, meeting rooms, and kitchen
  areas are shared spaces. It’s everybody’s job to keep the space
  clean and free of messes. This policy also applies when you are
  attending off-site events.

* **Stay involved and act as a steward.** As a member of the DSSG
  community, we expect a commitment from you to stay involved, even
  after the summer. We ask you to seek opportunities to present the
  work you did, whether it's at your university, company, or events in
  your area. We ask you to assist your team in writing publications
  about your project, both during and after the fellowship. We will
  also ask you to help us with the application process in the
  following years by reviewing applications and interviewing
  candidates. We ask that you do what you're able to contribute to the
  DSSG mission and community.


!!! warning "DON'T PANIC"
    Regardless of how much experience you have, we admitted you because we
    believe that you can make a valuable contribution to your cohort,
    and we think being a DSSG fellow will help prepare you to do data
    science for social good in the real world. We've made a commitment
    to you and want to do everything we can to help you succeed. This is
    really important, so we'll say it again, in bold: **If you're
    reading this, you are here because we want you to be here and
    believe that you are ready to make an impact.** For example, don't
    worry about how much more or less productive, knowledgable, or
    experienced other fellows in your cohort might appear to be. It's
    easy to only pay attention - and compare yourself - to those who
    seem to be doing particularly well. Know that everyone has their own
    struggles, and everyone has good and bad days.
