# The Space

Each year we reserve a space in the [host city](../../host-cities.md). While
the space changes from year to year, in general, the layout is open and teams sit at desks
together. There is private conference space for team meetings and
calls with partners. Upon arrival, you will receive the conference
room request and reservation policy. We also provide access to a
kitchen, with coffee and an espresso maker. We provide a limited
supply of snacks and catered meals for special events. Let us know if
you have any special food restrictions.

You will learn more about space logistics (location, key card access,
etc.) by email as they are finalized in the weeks leading up to the
fellowship.

# The People

The foundation of any good project is a good team. We’ve worked to
recruit and hand pick a passionate and skilled team of
interdisciplinary folks that all bring unique skills to your
cohort. The fellowship is comprised of teams of three or four
**fellows** each. Your teammates will be fellow students and
recent graduates. We aim to ensure that each team has a mix of
backgrounds, from computer science, statistics, math, physical science
and engineering, social sciences and public policy.

Your team will be assigned a **Data Science Mentor**. Each
Mentor will be working with several teams of fellows, supporting their
growth and project. All mentors are experienced data scientists who
serve as a resource for you through the project development process,
both with hands-on technical problems and implementation questions, as
well as through higher-level design decisions.

In addition to Data Science Mentors, you will have a **Project
Manager**. Each Project Manager oversees several teams and is
responsible for managing your relationship with your project
partner. They work with you and your partner to set goals and
deadlines, ensure proper communication between your team and your
partner, and help tackle issues that are blocking your progress. Your
Project Manager is also a great resource for questions about
organizing teamwork, improving presentation skills, and communicating
with the public.

If fellows have any kind of questions or concerns that they would like
to discuss confidentially, they can address the **Fellow
Advocate**. This is a member of the staff who is not involved directly in
managing the fellowship, and who is available to help with any
conflict between fellows and members of staff. The advocate can also
raise concerns or ask for help on behalf of fellows, should they feel
uncomfortable doing so themselves.

The fellowship has one or more **Interns**, who help with all
organizational and administrative tasks that the summer brings, like
setting up the space, helping organize and publicize events, and
recording tutorials. In their remaining time, interns might also help
teams with their projects or work on their own self-directed data
science projects.

The **Communications Manager** prepares media and press releases and
manages interactions with the press. The communications manager helps
fellows practice and polish their final presentations, and gives
feedback on blog posts and other write-ups. We strongly believe in the
importance of communicating the work we do, to our project partners,
as well as to the broader public. To that end, we will spend a lot of
the summer asking fellows to present their work and give them
continuous feedback on the presentations.

The **Fellowship Organizers** have spent months planning and preparing
the summer program. They select fellows, mentors, project managers,
interns, and project partners; find a space; secure funding; prepare
the summer’s curriculum; and plan all fellowship events. Over the
summer, they will lead some of the fellowship-wide activities (such as
the weekly deep dives and stand-ups), and teach some of the
workshops. They also supervise the mentors, project managers, interns,
and the communications manager.


# The Curriculum

Our goal is for you to learn a LOT this summer. We want you to feel
empowered to drive your education throughout the summer. We see
learning opportunities falling into three main buckets:

* **Self-Directed Learning**: We will share specific resources and
  guidelines for topics that we find useful in order to kick-start
  this learning process. We then encourage you to dive in and learn
  the skills most applicable to you and your growth.
* **Peer-Directed Learning**: We aim to create an environment that
  facilitates learning among fellows. Whether it’s an informal
  discussion over lunch or a more formal teaching session, we
  encourage you to take advantage of the diversity of experiences and
  skills in the room.
* **Fellowship-Directed Learning**: Lastly, we have developed a
  specific workshop curriculum to cover basic concepts that we believe
  are essential for the summer.

**It is up to you to make sure you are seeking the resources you need
to learn the skills you want to learn.** For example, in the past,
groups of fellows have started reading groups to learn about similar
topics, like deep learning, together. That being said, *if you are
lost, speak up.* You shouldn't feel that you are unable to make a
meaningful contribution to your project. Your data science mentor is
available to help you tackle skill gaps.

In all of this, we recognize that there is no definitive “Data Science
for Social Good” curriculum or roadmap. We are charting new territory
and developing it together. Throughout the summer, there will be
plenty of opportunities for feedback and brainstorming on how to
improve learning; for example, in past summers we have held an
informal “Dunkin’ Discussion” series where we discuss the future of
data science for social good over donuts.

# The Tools

We typically use [GitHub](https://github.com/dssg) for storing our
codebase, a cloud service provider like [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.com)
for our data storage and analysis, [Slack](https://slack.com) for fellowship-wide
communication, and [Trello](https://trello.com) for project management. We also store
team-wide and fellowship-wide documents on **Google Drive**, and we
schedule meetings on **Google Calendar**. You will receive an email
address from the host institution to use for the duration of the fellowship. You
are expected to use this for all fellowship-related communication.

!!! warning "Call to action!"
    Be sure that you create and share your username to all of this
    services.

    Also ask for the service's URL addresses specific to your project!


# The Communication

Teams will work together to develop specific team norms, but each team
will have a **daily morning stand up** meeting with their project manager
and technical mentors. In these meetings, each fellow will have the
opportunity to discuss what they did the day before, what they’re
planning to do today, and what they’re stuck on.

In addition to that daily meeting, teams will have **weekly conference
calls** with their project partner to provide updates, ask questions,
and receive feedback on their progress.

# The Fun

While this is a job — and we expect you to treat it as such — we would
hate for the summer to be all work and no play. We want to help foster
a community among your cohort.

We start the summer off with [a host of orientation
events](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/2016/08/18/the-real-world-dssg/),
including a fellowship-wide picnic, a variety of icebreakers, and a
scavenger hunt for you to get to know the city. We host “Un-DSSG”, a
day for you to share your side passions (from fondue making to dance)
with your new peers. Throughout the summer, we host happy hours every
other week, and invite the larger data science, tech, startup,
government, and non-profit communities. Nearly daily, we pull out the
ping pong table after hours, often leading to intense rivalries
tracked on Slack by Pongbot.
