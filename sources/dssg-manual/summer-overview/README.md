# What to Expect

While the specifics will vary from project to project, the summer
will follow roughly the structure in our
[high level summer plan](High%20Level%20Plan%20for%20the%20Summer.pdf). 

## Before the Summer

Prior to your arrival, we'll provide you with [the
prerequisites](../../curriculum/setup/software-setup/)
so you can familiarize yourself with the tools you’ll use over the summer, install them on your local machine, 
and equip yourself with the knowledge to be able to
follow along with the curriculum. You'll receive a longer list of software to
install before the first day of orientation, programming languages you
should brush up on, and tools we suggest you use to manage your ML/Data
workflow. 

## Learning about Projects and Partners

Staff at the [Data Science and Public
Policy team](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/) at CMU and DSSG alum volunteers have worked hard to
recruit partners and scope projects. This is a lengthy, complicated
process with plenty of logistical hurdles (think
legal data sharing agreements and data transfer challenges), which
means the list of project partners is usually not
finalized until we get close to the beginning of the fellowship. We'll usually give you a list of potential projects a couple of weeks 
before the start and ask you to give us a list of your project preferences. We'll use that, the needs of each project, and other things we want to balance across the team members (skills, backgrounds, experience, disciplines) to create project teams (typically of four fellows each) during the first week of the program. Fellows typically gwet the project assignments at the beginning of week 2.

We want you to meet the people you’re working with face to face and get to know them in the beginning of the summer so you can work with them effectively for the rest of the program. We ask all our project partners to come meet their team in the second week of the summer. 
During partner visits, you’ll spend a lot of time talking with them about the problem and the data, 
and they will give a presentation to the fellowship.
This also gives all of the fellows a chance to hear about
all of the projects and for the partners to meet other project partners and the other fellows.

After orientation, you will spend the first part of the summer getting
to know your project partner and their unique
challenges. While the projects have already been (initially) scoped, you will
almost certainly need to refine that scope throughout the
summer. For example, we may know your partner’s goal is to find
violations of a particular law. Your team would then work
with the partner to narrow that to: (1) locations at risk of
violations in general; (2) locations at risk of multiple
violations; or (3) locations with the most impactful violations.

We believe it is important for you to thoroughly understand the
problem, how the project partner is currently takcling it, the challenges associated with it, as well as the people and the processes
that generate the data we are getting before we get deeper. A better understanding of
your partner and the problems they face is crucial to
knowing what the rows and columns in your data  really mean. Defining your outcome and
evaluation metrics will depend heavily upon this
understanding. While we know you are eager to dig into the
data, you will find that at least as much of your time is
devoted to talking about the data as manipulating it. This is a good thing.

You will also be working with real data, which is messy! You will
encounter missing values and things that don’t seem to make
sense. Talking to your partners about their existing process, and sharing with them what you see from
analyzing their data will help you judge your own understanding of their problem, data, and processes, reconcile inconsistencies (or carry
on being aware of them), and identify whether the errors
lie in the data itself or in the information you weere provided.

## Working on Your Project

Although we aim to have all the data from project partners ready
in advance of the fellowship, there are inevitably
data transfer delays and partial data that will continue to be
augmented throughout - and sometimes after - the fellowship.
As you explore, you'll find holes in the provided information, or
identify potential new useful sources of data, and will
need to work with your partner to decide whether it’s possible to
acquire the data you need in the time that you have;
that’s the reality of working with real world partners and sensitive data!

Fellows drive the work of every project, learning about the domain and problem they're tackling
in depth, writing code, analyzing data, and collaborating with
their project anbd comunity partners to develop a useful and usable system. Over
the course of the summer, your team will:

* Explore the (real) data your partners have provided
* Design your project workflow based on what tools you'll use and how your team works together
* Identify user stories to make sure what you're creating has a real purpose
* Develop a machine learning pipeline to turn raw data into analysis that can inform decisions
* Build relevant models that reflect the subject you're analyzing as closely as possible
* Add features to your model based on subject matter expertise, available data, and exploratory analysis
* Evaluate model performance using the metrics that make sense for your project
* Create an interface for your partner to use your results (API, dashboard applications, etc)

## Presentations

We believe that our work is only useful if we are able to communicate
what we do and why it’s important to our partners,
peers, and the general public. As such, an important piece of this training program is
[learning to present the work you
do](../../curriculum/communication/).

Each week, a member of your team will give a 3-5 minute update to the
entire fellowship, outlining your recent progress
and findings, giving shoutouts to other fellows or staff members who
have helped you along the way, and things you're stuck
on and are seeking help with. Two teams per week (so each team
presents 2-3 times throughout the summer) will give a longer
20-minute "deep dive" presentation, outlining more technical
components of your project and seeking feedback from other
fellows and mentors.

!!! info "At the end of the summer…"
    At the end of the summer, your team will develop **two polished
    presentations**: one 5-minute presentation for the DataFest
    final event, and one 20-minute technical presentation for use at a
    local tech meetup at the end of the summer and for future
    presentations at conferences or your home institution.

In the last few weeks of the fellowship, each team will present at a
local meetup. Each team will elect one team member to
deliver the short final presentation at DataFest; however, all team
members should feel comfortable delivering all
presentations. Our communications staff will work with you on both of
these presentations, brainstorming ways to present
your work and providing feedback on your delivery.

## Wrap-Up and Handovers

To make sure the work you do this summer has real impact, a lot more
work needs to be done after the official end of the
fellowship; some of this will be done by your project partner, and
some will be done by the [Data Science and Public Policy team](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/) at Carnegie Mellon University. 
You will need to transition the work over to your project partners so they can
validate, implement, and extend your work. To do this, you will have
to document your work throughout the summer and wrap
it up neatly at the end of the summer.

We ask that you prepare a poster to be displayed at DSSG events and
for potential conference poster sessions, a technical
report, and an outline of a paper. This makes it easier to collaborate
once you and your teammates are no longer working
at the same desk every day. We also ask that all your code is tested to run
on a new machine, and that there is sufficient
documentation for someone else to replicate and understand your work.

## Curriculum
Our number one goal is to train the fellows to do data science for
social good work. Here is some insight into how
we accomplish this throughout the summer.

To look through all of our curriculum materials, please see the
[curriculum
section](../../curriculum/).

## Orientation
We expect that every incoming fellow has experience programming in
Python, a basic working knowledge of statistics and social
science, and an interest in doing social good work. However, we understand
that everyone comes from a different background,
so to ensure that everyone is able to contribute as a productive
member of the team and the fellowship, we start the first
few weeks off with an intensive orientation ([see sample from 2022](Week%201%20Orientation%20Schedule%202022.pdf)), getting everyone
"up to speed" with the basic skills and tools they'll need.

##  Ongoing Curriculum
Training continues on throughout the summer in the form of "lunch and
learns" - less formal lessons over lunch - and
teachouts by staff or fellows who have relevant
specializations. Sometimes we ask for volunteers to do a teachout on
a topic we think is important, like data visualization or inference
with observational data, and a few fellows will work
together to put together a lesson. Sometimes a DSSGer will suggest a
topic that they have a pet interest in, or that they
think will be relevant to one or more of the summer projects. We have
lunch and learns scheduled twice a week through the
summer, and some fellows choose to offer optional teachouts at the end of the workday.

Although we don't expect all teams to be working in unison, there is a [general structure](High%20Level%20Plan%20for%20the%20Summer.pdf)
to the summer that guides how we pace the remaining curriculum - we
try to schedule topics so that fellows know about
them with enough time to incorporate them into their projects, but not
so early that they've forgotten about what they
learned by the time the knowledge would be useful. As we get nearer to
the end of the summer, there are fewer required
topics, so there are more open time slots for fellows to do teachouts.
