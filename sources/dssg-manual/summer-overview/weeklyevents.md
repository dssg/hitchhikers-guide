# Weekly Events at DSSG

**Monday mornings**: Overview of the week, goals, and speicial events and visitors, and recapping where different teams are

**Tuesday afternoons**: Weekly Short Updates. Each team gives a 3-5 minute update on what they've achieved last week, their plans for this week, and anything they're blocked on or need help with.

**Thursday morning**: Deep Dives. Each week, 2 teams do a 20-minute deeper dive into their project focusing on an aspect based on the stage they're in the summer. With six teams, each team will present 3 times over the week. THe first deep dive eill typically focus on the scope and the data. The second deep dive will typically discuss the solution being built and preliminary results and findings. 
The third deep dive will focus on more results, validation and deployment plans.

**Happy hours**: We typically do happy hours every couple of weeks and invite people from the local government, non-profit, academic, and tech communities. 
The goal is to connect the fellows with the local communities, and to connect the local communities with our fellows and our work.

**Friday Talks**: We'll typically have a speaker come in every friday to give a talk as well as spend the day with us. Topics span social issues, ML and AI, Social Sciences, Data and Social Good Career Paths and people coming in from government agencies, non-profits, tech companies, foundations, and academia.

**Friday Ethics Discussions**: Friday afternoons, we break up into smaller (6-7 person) groups that cut across project teams and discuss ethical issues related to the work that we're doing, focusing on the phase of the project we're currently in,
and the downstream ethical implications of the choices we're making now. This is a key part of our ethics "curriculum" where each week we explore what actions we can take now that can help us reduce the downstream risks on people we are trying to help.
