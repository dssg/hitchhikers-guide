# Presentations and Communications

We need to remember that it's very difficult to have a social impact
through doing data science for social good work if you cannot convince
organizations to work with you and tackle a problem, if no one
understands what you did, and if they can't be convinced to use what
you've done. We need to be able to communicate effectively abouthe
work and spend a lot of time at DSSG training fellows on how to do
that. Here are some resources that you'll find useful:

[Data Visualization](vizualization/) and [Presentation Skills](presentation-on-presentations.pdf)
will help with that, whether you're communicating your work to a public audience or to stakeholders. When you're
working directly with a project partner and are creating tools for them to use, keep
[Usability and User Interfaces](user_interface/) in mind to make sure that
whatever tools you create will be useful and usable.
