# Introduction to the Unix Command Line

## Why Use the Command Line?

These days, most of us interact with our computers primarily through point-and-click GUIs, which provide a convenient and intuitive means of navigating your operating system and software. So, why use the command line instead of a GUI? There are several reasons:

1. In the shell you can easily handle data by chaining programs into a cohesive pipeline
to handle large amounts of data.

2. You can automate your workflow through scripting to save time and be more productive. A good
rule of thumb is if you do something twice -- script it!

3. Your work will be much more reproducible because there will be a
digital record of the steps you took to produce your results compared to
point and clicking in a program like Excel.

4. If you're working with remote machines, like supercomputers or
machines in the cloud, the CLI is often the only interface available.

5. The CLI is usually much faster -- once you get the hang out of it.

- [This 2016 Tutorial](cmdline-2016.md) introduces several of the tools for getting and manipulating data at the command line, such as `curl`, `grep`, `cut`, `awk`, and `sed`

- [Living in the Terminal](../../programming_best_practices/living-in-the-terminal/) has some good details on best practices, shell scripting basics, and editing code directly in the terminal with `vim`
