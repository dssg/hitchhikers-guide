## What is Git 


## Why we use it 


## How it works
let's take a look at how we can use git. 

### How to initialize your git repository? 

You can create a new directory, and to make it a git repository, we can use the `git init` command. 

```
$ mkdir my-git-repo
$ cd my-git-repo
$ git init
```

Alternatively, if we want to contribute to an already existing repository, we can use the command 

```
git clone /path/to/repo
```

You most likely will be prompted to autheticate your credentials when cloning a remote repo (e.g., from GitHub). 

Hint: You can upload your public SSH key to your Github profile to avoid being prompted


### What is the typical workflow? 

```
git add
```

```
git commit
```

```
git push
```
