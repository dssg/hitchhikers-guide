# Python

Python is the language of choice here at DSSG. If you’re only going to
learn one programming language, learn Python! It’s powerful,
expressive, and easy to read (even by non-programmers).

## Python Package & Environment Management


  - To properly create a python environment, we recommend you use [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) /
  [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html).

## Some e-books

- [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) An amazing book from Allen B. Downey.
  - Also check all of his book series [*Think …*](http://greenteapress.com/)!
- [Lectures in Quantitative Economics](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/) A Econometrics  web course with `python` code
- [A tutorial for Economists](http://www.alexmbell.com/python-tutorial-for-economists/) A short (34 pages!) intro to python
- [Python for Informatics - Exploring Information](https://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php#python-for-informatics) A more traditional (CS) approach
