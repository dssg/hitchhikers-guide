# Record Linkage

It is often necessary to combine data from multiple sources to get a complete picture of entities we're analyzing. As data scientists, in addition to just linking data, we are also concerned
about issues of missing links, duplicative links, and erroneous links.
Record linkage methods range from traditional rule-based and
probabilistic approaches, to more modern approaches using machine learning.

## Background and Motivation

The goal of record linkage is to determine if pairs of records describe
the same entity. This is important for removing duplicates from a data
source or joining two separate data sources together. Record linkages
also goes by the terms -- data matching, merge/purge, duplication detection,
de-duping, reference matching, co-reference/anaphora -- in various fields. There
are several approaches to record linkage that includes exact matching,
rule-based linking and probabilistic linking. An example of exact matching
is joining records based on social security number. Rule-based matching
involves applying a cascading set of rules that reflect the domain knowledge
of the records being linked. In probabilistic record linkage, linkage weights
are calculated based on records and a threshold is applied to make a decision
of whether to link records or not.
