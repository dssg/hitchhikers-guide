# Causal Inference Methods

Many problems and questions in social good and public policy require causal inferencew methods to be used. 
This often involve questions around effectiveness of interventions in most domains that we will deal with. 
The methods discussed here will cover two broad areas:
1. Experimental Methods
2. Causal inference methods using observational data. See two versions of tutorials we've done on this:
  - [DSSG 2016](../3_modeling_and_machine_learning/causal-inference/causal-inference-with-observational-data.pdf)
  - [DSSG 2018](../3_modeling_and_machine_learning/causal-inference/causalinference_observational_dssg2018.pdf)
