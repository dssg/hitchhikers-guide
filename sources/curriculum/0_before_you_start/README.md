## Before You Start 
So you want to start a DSSG project! First, please make sure you have gone through the [Prerequisites](prerequisites/)
and [Software Setup](software-setup/) and are equipped with the basic knowledge and tools you'll need.
Then use our [Project Scoping Intro](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/2016/10/27/scoping-data-science-for-social-good-projects/)
to help you decide on a project or refine a project you already have in mind. 
Then, check out [Pipelines and Project Workflow](pipelines-and-project-workflow/) for an
overview of how the steps of your project (and, therefore, your code) will be organized.
