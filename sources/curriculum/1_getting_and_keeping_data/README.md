# Getting and Keeping Data

Data comes in many forms, from many sources - you may get a database dump directly from a project partner,
or you may need to scrape data from the web (see [Basic Web Scraping](basic-web-scraping/README.md)). Either way,
once you've got your hands on some data, you'll need to bring it into a [database](databases/README.md), and start formatting it in such a way that you can use it for analysis. [Command Line Tools](../setup/command-line-tools/README.md) will start to come in handy here. If your data is in a format that resembles `CSV` [this instructions will be helpful](csv-to-db/README.md).
 You'll definitely want to keep track
of the steps you took to go from raw data to model-ready data ([Reproducible ETL](reproducible_ETL/README.md)).

Often data science for social good
projects will involve sensitive data, so it's important to be aware of some basic principles of data security:
[Data Security Primer](../get_data/data-security-primer/README.md).
