# Machine Learning

## Motivation
You've probably heard about machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc. It's 
an integral part of data science. So we'll teach you the basics about ML: the 
process, formulating a problem in a machine learning setting, feature generation,
model selection and evaluation, and how to interpret results before eventually deploying the models. 

For a more detailed coverage of machine learning for social good and policy, you can take a look at [lectures for the Machine Learning and Public Policy class](https://github.com/dssg/MLforPublicPolicy). 

We have a few overview topics in this guide:
-[Intro to Machine Learning Slides](machine-learning-overview.pdf)
-[Machine Learning Book Chapter from Big Data and Social Science](mlchapter.pdf)
-[Jupyer Notebook going over building ML models](machine_learning_clean.ipynb)
-[Ethics, Bias, Fairness in ML](ethics-ML.pdf)
