    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When you combine information from multiple sources, you have to determine whether two individuals in two separate datasets are the same. You also might have multiple individuals with the same name in one dataset and need to decide whether to treat them as the same person or not. This has important implications for your analysis. Record linkage also goes by the terms data matching, merge/purge, duplication detection, de-duping, reference matching, co-reference/anaphora in various fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches to record linkage that include **exact matching** (for example, joining records based on social security number), **rule-based linking** (applying a hierarchical set of rules that reflect domain knowledge; for example, if two people have the same first and last name and the same birthday they are considered the same); and **probabilistic linking**, or estimating the likelihood that two entities are the same and then deciding on a threshold above which two individuals will be considered to be the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover preprocessing data, rule-based linkage and probabilitic linkage using the Felligi-Sunter model. It was adapted from the [Big Data and Social Science Data Linkage tutorial](https://github.com/CSSIP-AIR/Big-Data-Workbooks/blob/master/08.%20Data%20Linkage/Record%20Linkage.ipynb). \n",

The number of insertions (adding a letter), deletions (removing a letter) and substitutions (swapping one letter for another) to transform one string to another is known as the *Levenshtein distance* between the two words.

    "The final way is matching records *probabilistically*.  The **Fellegi-Sunter** model compares selected similiar fields in two records and calculates a similarity score, or a weighted probablity of the two records being the same entity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is the following: two fields are first compared using a metric, in this case, the Jaro-Winkler distance (which can be between 0 and 1). The Jaro-Winkler distance is binned into one of three categories: exact match, close match, or no match. Each category has an associated distribution, based on known matches and unmatches. The log probability of being a match and the log probability of being a non-match are calculated for each pair. The final score is the log probablity of being a match minus the log probablity of being a non-match. If the final score is greater than a threshold, then the records are considered to match.\n",
