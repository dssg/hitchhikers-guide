## [Modeling and Machine Learning](3_modeling_and_machine_learning/)
Let's make some models! Most of the modeling techniques you'll use, whether supervised or unsupervised,
will fall under the umbrella of [machine learning](machine-learning/), but that's not all you need to know. 
Knowing some social science will go a long way when it comes to formulating your models appropriately, designing 
experiments to evaluate model performance, and understanding what conclusions you can make based on your results. 
[Quantitative Social Science](quantitative-social-science/) and [Causal Inference with Observational Data](causal-inference/)
will help you think these questions through.
