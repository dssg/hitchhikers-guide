    "# Text Analysis\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Analysis is used for summarizing or getting useful information out of a large amount of unstructured text stored in documents. This opens up the opportunity of using text data alongside more conventional data sources (e.g, surveys and administrative data). The goal of text analysis is to take a large corpus of complex and unstructured text data and extract important and meaningful messages in a comprehensible meaningful way. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Analysis can help with the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Informationa retrieval**: Help find relevant information in large databases such as a systematic literature review. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustering and text categorization**: Techniques like topic modeling modeling can summarize a large corpus of text by finding the most important phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Create category-sensitive text summaries of a large corpus of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine Translation**: Translate from one language to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to analyze job advertisements from 2010-2015 using topic modeling to examine the content of our data and document classification to tag the type of job in the advertisement while going over how to transform our data into a matrix that can be read in by an algorithm. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Glossary of Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corpus**: A corpus of documents is the set of all documents in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenize**: Tokenization is the process by which text is sepearated into meaningful terms or phrases. In english this is fairly triial as words as separated by whitespace. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming**: Stemming is a type of text normalization where words that have different forms but their essential meaning are normalized to the original dictionary form of a word. For example \"go,\" \"went,\" and \"goes\" all stem from the lemma \"go.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TFIDF**: TFIDF (Term frequency-inverse document frequency) is an example of feature enginnering where the most important words are extracted by taking account their frequency in documents and the entire corpus of documents as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Topic Modeling**: Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning method where groups of co-occuring words are clustered into topics. Typically, the words in a a cluster should be related and make sense (e.g, boat, ship, captain). Individual documents will then fall into multiple topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **LDA**: LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) is a type of probabilistic model commonly used for topic modelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stop Words**: Stop words are words that have little semantic meaning like prepositions, articles and common nouns. They can often be ingnored. "

    " We are going to apply topic modeling, an unsuperivised learning method, to our corpus to find the high-level topics in our corpus as a first-go for exploring our data. As we apply topic modeling we will discuss ways to cleaning and preprocessing our data to get better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is a broad subfield of machine learning and natural language processing. We are going to focus on one approach, Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). LDA is a fully Bayesian extension of probabilistic latent semantic  indexing, itself a probabilistic extension of latent semantic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In topic modeling we first assume the existence of topics in the corpus and there is a small number of topics that can explain a corpus. Topics, in this case, are a ranked-list of words from our corpus, with the highest probability words at the top. A document can be explained by multiple topics. For instance, an article on net neutrality has to do with both technology and politics. The set of topics used by a document is known as the document's allocation, hence, the name latent Dirchlet allocation, each document has an allocation of latent topics goverend by Dirchlet distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Processing text data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first important step in working with text data is cleaning and processing the data. This include but is not limited to *forming a corpus of text, tokenization, removing stop-words, finding words colocated together (N-grams), and stemming and lemmatization*. Each of these steps will be discussed below. The ultimate goal is to transform our text data into a form an algorithm can work with. A sequence of symbols cannot be fed directly into an algorithm. Algorithms expect numerical feature vectors with fixed size rather then a document with a variable document length. We will be transforming our text corpus into a *bag of n-grams* to be further analyzed. In this form our text data is represented as a matrix where each row refers to a specific job description (document) and each column is the occurence of a word (feature).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag of n-gram representation example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we want to take our collection of documents, corpus, and convert it into a matrix. Fortunately sklearn has an pre-built object, `CountVectorizer`, that can tokenize, eliminate stopwords, identify n-grams and stem our corpus, outputing a matrix in one step. Before we apply the vectorizer on our corpus of data we are going to apply it to a toy example so we can understand the output and how a bag of words is represented. "

    "To clean and normalize text we will remove all special characters, numbers, and punctuation. Then we will make all the text lowercase to normalize the text;  this is so words like \"the\" and \"The\" will be counted as the same in our analysis. To remove the special characters, numbers and pucntuation we will use regular expressions. \n",

    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions or regexes match a certain amount text in a document based on a set of rules and syntax. The name \"regular expressions\" actually comes from the mathematical theory it is based on. These rules are useful for pulling out useful information in a large amount of text (e.g., email addresses, html-tags, credit card numbers). Regexes often match text much more quickly then plain text sorting and can often reduce their development time. Some regular expressions can become quite complicated and it may then become a good idea to write code using Python. Any developer should keep in mind there is a trade-off between optimization and understandibility. In Python, a general philosophy is code is meant to be as understandable by *people* as much as possible. You should therefore always tend toward the understandabilty side of things rather than overly optimizing your code. Your future-self, code-reviewers, people who inherit your code, and anyone else who has to make sense of your code in the will aprreciate it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes we are going to use a regular expression to match all characters that are not letters -- punctutation, quotes, special characters and numbers --replace them with spaces and then take all the remaining characters and make them lowercase. \n",
    "\n",
    "A full tutorial on regular expressions would be outside the scope of this tutorial. There are many good tutorials that can be found on-line. There is also a great interactive tool for developing and checking regular expressions regex101.com. \n",

In supervised learning, we produce a label, *y*, given some data *x*. In order to produce labels we need to first have examples our algorithm can learn from, a training set. Developing a training set can be very expensive, as it can require a large amount of human labor or linguistic expertise. Document classification is the case where our x are documents and our y are what the documents are (e.g, title for a job position). A common example of document classification is spam detection in emails. In sentiment analysis our x is our documents and y is the state of the author. This can range from an author being happy or unhappy with a product or the autor being pollitically conservative or liberal. There is also Part-of-speech tagging were our x are individual words and y is the part-of-speech. \n",
