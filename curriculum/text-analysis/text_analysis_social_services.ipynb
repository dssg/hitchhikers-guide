    "# Text Analysis\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text analysis** is used to extract useful information from or summarize a large amount of unstructured text stored in documents. This opens up the opportunity of using text data alongside more conventional data sources (e.g. surveys and administrative data). The goal of text analysis is to take a large corpus of complex and unstructured text data and extract important and meaningful messages in a comprehensible way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text analysis can help with the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Information Retrieval**: Find relevant information in a large database, such as a systematic literature review, that would be very time-consuming for humans to do manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustering and Text Categorization**: Summarize a large corpus of text by finding the most important phrases, using methods like topic modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Create category-sensitive text summaries of a large corpus of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine Translation**: Translate documents from one language to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to analyze social services descriptions using topic modeling to examine the content of our data and document classification to tag the type of job in the advertisement. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will...\n",
    "* Learn how to transform a corpus of text into a structured matrix format so that we can apply natural language processing (NLP) methods\n",
    "* Learn the basics and applications of topic modeling\n",
    "* Learn how to do document tagging and evaluate the results\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Glossary of Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corpus**: A corpus is the set of all text documents used in your analysis; for example, your corpus of text may include hundreds of research articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenize**: Tokenization is the process by which text is separated into meaningful terms or phrases. In English this is easy to do for individual words, as they are separated by whitespace; however, it can get more complicated to  automate determining which groups of words constitute meaningful phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming**: Stemming is normalizing text by reducing all forms or conjugations of a word to the word's most basic form. In English, this can mean making a rule of removing the suffixes \"ed\" or \"ing\" from the end of all words, but it gets more complex. For example, \"to go\" is irregular, so you need to tell the algorithm that \"went\" and \"goes\" stem from a common lemma, and should be considered alternate forms of the word \"go.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TF-IDF**: TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) is an example of feature engineering where the most important words are extracted by taking account their frequency in documents and the entire corpus of documents as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Topic Modeling**: Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning method where groups of words that often appear together are clustered into topics. Typically, the words in one topic should be related and make sense (e.g. boat, ship, captain). Individual documents can fall under one topic or multiple topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **LDA**: LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is a type of probabilistic model commonly used for topic modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stop Words**: Stop words are words that have little semantic meaning but occur very frequently, like prepositions, articles and common nouns. For example, every document (in English) will probably contain the words \"and\" and \"the\" many times. You will often remove them as part of preprocessing using a list of stop words.\n"

    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is a broad subfield of machine learning and natural language processing. We are going to focus on a common modeling approach called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). \n",
    "\n",
    "To use topic modeling, we first have to assume that topics exist in our corpus, and that some small number of these topics can \"explain\" the corpus. Topics in this context refer to words from the corpus, in a list that is ranked by probability. A single document can be explained by multiple topics. For instance, an article on net neutrality would fall under the topic \"technology\" as well as the topic \"politics.\" The set of topics used by a document is known as the document's allocation, hence, the name Latent Dirchlet Allocation, each document has an allocation of latent topics allocated by Dirchlet distribution. \n",

    "## Processing Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first important step in working with text data is cleaning and processing the data, which includes (but is not limited to) *forming a corpus of text, tokenization, removing stop-words, finding words co-located together (N-grams), and stemming and lemmatization*. Each of these steps will be discussed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal is to transform our text data into a form an algorithm can work with, because a document or a corpus of text cannot be fed directly into an algorithm. Algorithms expect numerical feature vectors with certain fixed sizes, and can't handle documents, which are basically sequences of symbols with variable length. We will be transforming our text corpus into a *bag of n-grams* to be further analyzed. In this form our text data is represented as a matrix where each row refers to a specific job description (document) and each column is the occurence of a word (feature).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag of N-gram Representation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we want to take our collection of documents, corpus, and convert it into a matrix. Fortunately, `sklearn` has a pre-built object, `CountVectorizer`, that can tokenize, eliminate stopwords, identify n-grams, and stem our corpus, and output a matrix in one step. Before we apply the vectorizer to our corpus of data, let's apply it to a toy example so that we see what the output looks like and how a bag of words is represented. "

These rules are useful for pulling out useful information from a large amount of text. For example, if you want to find all email addresses in a document, you might look for everything that looks like *some combination of letters, _, .* followed by *@*, followed by more letters, and ending in *.com* or *.edu*. If you want to find all the credit card numbers in a document, you might look for everywhere you see the pattern \"four numbers, space, four numbers, space, four numbers, space, four numbers.\" Regexes are also helpful if you are scraping information from websites, because you can use them to separate the content from the HTML code used for formatting the website.\n",

Any developer should keep in mind there is a trade-off between optimization and understandability. The general philosophy of programming in Python is that your code is meant to be as understandable by *people* as much as possible, because human time is more valuable than computer time. You should therefore lean toward understandability rather than overly optimizing your code to make it run as quickly as possible. Your future-self, code-reviewers, people who inherit your code, and anyone else who has to make sense of your code in the future will appreciate it. \n",

Another example of supervised learning in text analysis is *sentiment analysis*, where *X* is our documents and *Y* is the state of the author. This \"state\" is dependent on the question you're trying to answer, and can range from the author being happy or unhappy with a product to the author being politically conservative or liberal.

    "Recall from the machine learning tutorial that we are seeking the find the most general pattern in the data in order to have to most general model that will be successful at classifying new unseen data. Our previous strategy above was the *Out-of-sample and holdout set*. With this strategy we try to find a general pattern by randomly dividing our data into a test and training set based on some percentage split (e.g., 50-50 or 80-20). We train on the test set and evaluate on the test set, where we pretend that we don't have the labels for the test set. A significant drawback with this approach is that we may be lucky or unlucky with our random split, and so our estimate of how we'd perform on truly new data is overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. A possible solution is to create many random splits into training and testing sets and evaluate each split to estimate the performance of a given model. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more sophisticated holdout training and testing procedure is *cross-validation*. In cross-validation we split our data into *k* folds or partitions, where *k* is usually 5 or 10. We then iterate k times. In each iteration, one of the folds is used as a test set, and the rest of the folds are combined to form the training set. We can then evaluate the performance at each iteration to estimate the performance of a given method. An advantage of using cross-validation is all examples of data are used in the training set at least once. \n"
