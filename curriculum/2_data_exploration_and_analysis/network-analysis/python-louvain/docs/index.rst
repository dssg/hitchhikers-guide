Community detection for NetworkX's documentation
=================================================
This module implements community detection.


It uses the louvain method described in
Fast unfolding of communities in large networks,
Vincent D Blondel, Jean-Loup Guillaume, Renaud Lambiotte, Renaud Lefebvre,
Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment 2008(10), P10008 (12pp)

It depends on Networkx to handle graph operations :
http://networkx.lanl.gov/

The program can be found in a repository where you can also report bugs :

Example :
=========

As a classical software :
-------------------------
You should consider using the cpp version at
http://findcommunities.googlepages.com/ !

./community.py file.bin > tree



where file.bin is a binary graph as generated by the convert utility of the cpp
version.

You can after that use the generated file with the hierarchy utility of the cpp
version.
Note that the program does not make much verifications about the arguments,
and is expecting a friendly use.

As python module : 
------------------

::

    import community
    import networkx as nx
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    #better with karate_graph() as defined in networkx example.
    #erdos renyi don't have true community structure
    G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(30, 0.05)

    #first compute the best partition
    partition = community.best_partition(G)

    #drawing
    size = float(len(set(partition.values())))
    pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
    count = 0.
    for com in set(partition.values()) :
        count = count + 1.
        list_nodes = [nodes for nodes in partition.keys()
                                    if partition[nodes] == com]
        nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, list_nodes, node_size = 20,
                                    node_color = str(count / size))


    nx.draw_networkx_edges(G,pos, alpha=0.5)
    plt.show()




Changelog :
===========

* 04/21/2011 : modificatios to use networkx like documentation and use of test.
* 02/22/2011 : correction of a bug regarding edge weights
* 01/14/2010 : modification to use networkx 1.01 graph api and adding the possibility to start the algorithm with a given partition
* 04/10/2009 : increase of the speed of the detection by caching node degrees
