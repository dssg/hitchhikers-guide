# Summer Overview and What to Expect

#### Introduction of key people, a typical week, and the summer overview.
 
## Scheduling and Typical Week at DSSG 
There will be (on average) one daily all-DSSG event. It will be clearly stated what is and isn’t mandatory.
- **Standups** Monday mornings (9:30 AM) - check in once a week with the whole fellowship (usually daily with your team and PM)
- **Project Check-ins** Tuesday afternoons (3 PM) - each team gives a 2-3 minute update on their progress. What's working, what isn't, kudos to anyone who helped you out with something.
- **Deep dives** Wednesday afternoons (3 PM) - two teams give 20 minute overviews that dive deeper into their project, with a focus on the "theme" of that week. 
- **Tutorials & Teach-outs** - Twice a week (Monday/Thursday) at lunchtime (solicitation for teachouts, talk to Jane).
- **Friday speakers** - External speakers from industry, government, academia, and nonprofits. Some will be talks, some will be panels. We bring in lunch and invite speakers to stay and chat informally over lunch. 
- **Discussion groups** - 4 groups meeting Friday afternoons (one person from each team in every discussion group), around ethics in tech & data. Topics can be outside readings from industry or academia or issues fellows have encountered in their work. 
- **Happy hours** - Every other Thursday afternoon. Feel free to invite friends and connections from tech, any visitors you have, all are welcome. 
- **Summer Kick-off Party**  
- **Data Fest and Conference**
