# The Work We Do

## Motivation

## Concepts
- Past projects of different kinds (e.g. Lead, Police, LID)
- Resource allocation projects (e.g. EPA, High School)
- Dangers (e.g. similarity of technology between EPA and Predictive Policing, but not interpretation/implementation)
- Misinterpretations of data or results, how miscommunication can lead to bad decisions
