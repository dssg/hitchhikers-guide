# Project Scoping

## Motivation
Fellows will meet partners in week 2. The projects have been scoped but they will need to be continually refined as fellows talk to the partners, better understand the project, and start to work with the data. 

## Concepts
What criteria did we use to select proects?

1. social impact
2. partners that are able to commit to the program and have data they can share
* post process continuation, why we didnâ€™t do a bike share, what will you be doing in week 2, thinking critically about what the partner will do with it, what are actions/interventions, do they have the data to do what they want to do?
