# Creating the Fellowship

## Motivation
Fellows arrive in the first week and are curious about what went on behind the scenes to make the fellowship happen - why and how did it start? How were projects scoped and chosen? How were fellows and staff selected? 

## Concepts

* **Projects:** Finding & Initial Screening - which projects didnâ€™t we continue with and why
* **Fellows:** Selection process & attributes that we were looking for 
* **Staff:** Selection process & attributes that we were looking for
* Importance of different disciplines in the fellowship
