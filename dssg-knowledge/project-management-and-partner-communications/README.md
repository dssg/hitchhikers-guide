# Project Communications 

## Motivation
This is many fellows' first time working on projects in teams and with partners in professional settings. 

## Learning goals

1. Know how to interact with partners
	- Who? (initially Project Managers but gradually fellows)
	- How? (Visits, etc.)
		- What does a weekly meeting/call with the partner look like?
		- Agenda / action items / note taking / follow up
	- When? (Weekly)
	* Do and don'ts 
	* License to 'act stupid'
	* Ask clarifyig questions (Why why why?)

2. Know how to prepare for upcoming visits
	- Who's coming
	- What preparations are required?
		- Read project charters
		- Glance at the data
	- practice communications beforehand (role playing?) 

3. Know which tools we intend to use over the summer
	- Trello (will require training, TBC)
	- Calendars
	- Email
	- Slack
	- Video/Teleconferencing

4. Be aware of what the main deliverables are over the summer
	- Technical report?
	- Software prototype?

## Concepts
- Communications with partners (who conducts them, how often, professional standards)
- Email communication and accounts 
- How do Project Managers work at DSSG and within their teams? Which media should be used and when? How often should you check Trello, email, Slack, etc. ?
- Calendars and scheduling - do project partners have access to the correct calendars? what are the norms if something is rescheduled? 
- Refining the scope of the project over the summer - how to talk to and disagree with partners, deal with pushback, change and ambiguity, or ethical concerns about your project
- Each project will have a different goal - some of them will produce analysis reports, some produce insights based on models, some generate ranked/scored lists, and some will be software prototypes. 
- All projects will evolve over the summer, but not all will be implemented. Some will be implemented, some will lead to pilots and field trials, and some die on the vine due to unforeseen circumstances with data or personnel at partner organizations. A handful will continue at DSaPP. Projects wonâ€™t be production code, but must be reproducible (able to run on different a machine without prior knowledge). Many teams use out-of-the-box ML because ETL takes time, and results are more important than methods.
