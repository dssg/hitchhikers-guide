# Best Practices: Writing Good, Legible Code

## Motivation
All fellows will have to write code that is usable and understandable by their peers and partners, and potentially other 3rd parties. What does that entail in practice? Many fellows are coming from academic backgrounds, have programming skills that are self-taught, and have never worked collaboratively on a software project before. We want to help them establish good habits and avoid common mistakes.

## Potential Teachouts

## Concepts
Comments, documentation, modules, environments, version control, repo. How would a new person get on board?
