# Software Setup Session

## Motivation

Every team will settle on a specific setup with their tech mentors. This setup will determine, for example:
- which Python version to use
- versioning via virtual environments
- maintaining package dependencies
- continuous testing tools
- your version control workflow.

Today, we're **not** doing that. We're making sure that everybody has some basic tools they will need for the tutorials and the beginning of the fellowship, and that you can log into the server and database.

### Format

Work through the prerequisites below, making sure that all the software you installed works.

Affix three kinds of post-it notes to your laptop:
- one with your operating system, e.g. 'Ubuntu 14.04'
- if you get an app working (e.g. ssh), write its name on a **green** post-it and stick it to your screen
- if you tried - but the app failed - write its name on a **red** post-it

If you're stuck with a step, ask a person with a corresponding green post-it (and preferrably your operating system) for help.

The tech mentors will hover around and help with red stickers.

You will need a few credentials for training accounts. We'll post them up front.

**Important**: The notes below aren't self-explanatory and will not cover all (or even the majority) of errors you might encounter. Make good use of the people in the room!

Let's get this over with!

## Package Manager

A package manager will make your life easier.
- on Mac, install [Brew](http://brew.sh/)
- on Linux, you probably already have yum or apt
- on Windows, you could install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) to provide a lot of Linux-style functionality; ask Windows users around you for their preferred way to manage packages

## Git and GitHub Account
1. If you don't have a GitHub account, [make one](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)!

2. Add your username to the spreadsheet on Slack. We'll add your username to the DSSG organization on GitHub.

3. Install Git:
 ```
 brew update
 brew install git
 ```
 (and similar for `yum` or `apt`). On Windows, Cygwin can provide git.

4. Configure Git and GitHub. GitHub has, as always, [great instructions for that](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

5. Test your installation. For example, create a directory, and make it a git repo:
 ```
 mkdir mytestdir
 cd mytestdir/
 git init
 ```
 ```
 > Initialized empty Git repository in [...]/mytestdir/.git/
 ```
You can un-git the directory by deleting the `.git` folder: `rm -r .git` (or simply delete `mytestdir` entirely).

## SSH / Putty

1. You should have already generated a key pair, and sent the public key to Joe, who will have generated a user account on the server for you. (If not, follow the instructions on [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/), namely 'Generating a new SSH key' and 'Adding your SSH key to ssh-agent'. Name your key by your first initial + last name, like _jsmith_. Then send your _public_ key to the box address we emailed you previously. Windows users probably want to use [git bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) or [PuTTYgen](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_puttygen)).

2. Use your private key file, your username on the server, and the server's URL to ssh into the server:
 ```
 ssh -i pathtoyourkey yourusername@serverurl
 ```
 This should drop you into a shell on the server:
 ```
 > jsmith@servername: ~$
 ```

If you run into an error, maybe the permissions on your private key are wrong? Do `chmod 600 pathtoyourkey` (with the correct path to your private key, of course).

## PSQL

The database server runs Postgres 9.4.7.

Windows users should skip the steps below, and instead use [DBeaver](http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/). When setting up the connection in DBeaver, you will need to specify the SSH tunnel; the database credentials are the ones we shared with you, and the SSH tunnel credentials are the ones you used in the previous step to SSH into the training server. Alternatively, everybody can access `psql` from the training server: SSH into the training server as in the step before, then, on the server's shell, call `psql -h POSTGRESURL -p 5432 -U USERNAME -d USERNAME`, where you need to substitute `POSTGRESURL` with the postgres server's address, and `USERNAME` with the username for the postgres [!] server.

For all non-Windows users, also do these steps to access the Postgres server from your local machine:

1. Make sure you have the `psql` client installed; on Mac, this would be
 ```
 brew install postgresql
 ```
 On Ubuntu: ```apt-get install postgresql-client-9.4```. This won't work for  Ubuntu <= 14.4, which by default only packages 9.3; in that case follow [these  instructions](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/). (Though the  older client seems to be happy to connect to the server, too.)

 Some Linux distributions might need to install `libpq`:
 ```
 sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
 ```
 or
 ```
 sudo yum install libpq-devel
 ```
 
 For Windows - or if you want a graphical interface to databases - you might  want to use [DBeaver](http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/).

2. Once you have the postgres client installed, you can access the training database with it. However, the database server only allows access from the training server. Thus, you need to set up an SSH tunnel through the training  server to the Postgres server:
 ```
 ssh -fNT -L 8888:POSTGRESURL:5432 -i pathtokey yourusername@SERVERURL
 ```
 where you need to substitute the `POSTGRESURL`, `pathtokey`, `yourusername` and `SERVERURL` with the postgres server's URL, the local path to your private SSH (for the training server), your user name on the training server, and the training server's URL, respectively. Also, you should substitute `8888` with a random number in the 8000-65000 range of your choice (port `8888` might be in use already). This command forwards the Postgres server's port 5432 (which serves Postgres) to your laptop's port 8888 (or whatever port you chose), but through your account on the training server. So if you access your local port 8888 in the next step, you get forwarded to the Postgres server's port 5432 - but from the Postgres server's view, the traffic is now coming from the training server (instead of your laptop), and the training server is the only IP address that is allowed to access the postgres server.

3. Connect to the Postgres database on the forwarded port
 ```
 psql -h localhost -p 8888 -U USERNAME -d USERNAME
 ```
 where you need to replace `USERNAME` with the postgres [!] username, and the `8888` with the number you chose in the previous step. You then get prompted for a password. This is now the postgres server asking, so you need to reply with the corresponding password!

 This should drop you into a SQL shell on the database server.
 
 For fun, make a schema with your name, and then drop it again:
 ```
 create schema jsmith;
 drop schema jsmith;
 ```

Note: After installing Postgres, you might have to add Postgres to your `PATH` (at least on OS X). You'd do this by adding a line to your `.bashrc`, similar to `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/postgres/binaries`, and then re-loading your `.bashrc` file: `source ~/.bashrc`

## Python

As said, your team will decide on which Python version (and versioning) to install. Thus, if you have any working setup already, don't break it (for now)! Just make sure you have the packages listed below installed.

1. If you have no Python installed at all, [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) makes installing a lot of packages easy, and it comes with `jupyter notebook`. Go for Python 3.5.

2. If you have a working Python installation, but you don't have `jupyter notebook`, [install jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

3. Make sure you have the following packages installed. If you use Anaconda, most of them will already be included. Simply call `conda install <packagename>`. Outside of conda, you might want to use `pip` to install packages instead. (Linux users might need to install the packages `libfreetype6-dev` and `libpng-dev` before installing the packages below.) You'll need:
  *   numpy
  *   scipy
  *   pandas
  *   matplotlib
  *   seaborn
  *   scikit-learn
  *   psycopg2
  *   statsmodels
  *   patsy
  *   csvkit
  *   nltk

4. Try importing the packages in a Python shell and see if it works:
 ```
 ~$ python
 >>> import pandas
 >>> pandas.__version__
 '0.15.1'
 >>> 
 ```
 
 (Note: The module name for scikit-learn is `sklearn`.)
   
## R

If you're on Mac or Windows, [download R](https://www.r-project.org/) and install it. (It seems that using `brew` with R is a [bit tricky](http://www.r-bloggers.com/installing-r-on-os-x-100-homebrew-edition/).) On Linux, R can probably be installed via your package manager.

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a popular R IDE that you might want to install, too.
