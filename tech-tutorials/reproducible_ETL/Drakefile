;  This is a Drakefile. It's a list of instructions for Drake.
;  Each section starts with inputs (on the right side of the arrow)
;  and outputs (on the left side of the arrow). 
;
;  Drake checks the timestamps on the inputs and outputs and
;  runs every step where the input is newer than the output,
;  as well as all the steps that depend on the output.




;;;  LOAD POSTGRES ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES  ;;;

;;;  DOWNLOAD AND UNZIP THE WEATHER DATA  ;;;

;  Drake can check timestamps on files and in S3 buckets
;  but not on websites. [-timecheck] disables timestamp
;  checking, so it only runs when the output is missing
;  or when the user forces the step to run.
/mnt/data/training/jwalsh/2016.csv.gz <- [-timecheck]
	URL="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/2016.csv.gz"

/mnt/data/training/jwalsh/2016.csv <- /mnt/data/training/jwalsh/2016.csv.gz
	gunzip -c $INPUT > $OUTPUT




;;; LOAD THE DATA  ;;;

;  Because our Postgres database doesn't have a timestamp we can check,
;  we create a fake file called `psql_weather` that tracks the timestamp.
/mnt/data/training/jwalsh/psql_weather <- jwalsh_table.sql, /mnt/data/training/jwalsh/2016.csv
	psql -f $INPUT0
