Learner A has done some work on the repo. It's time to share that work with the other two!

# Commands you'll learn

In this tutorial you'll be using the following commands:
* `git log`: Show a list of your commits so far
* `git push`: Sync your commits back to your repo's GitHub page (or another 'remote')


# Share What You Did

1. **Learner A**: Over time, you will do many commits. To see a list of them, do `git log`. There's only one so far!

2. **Learner A**: Now, it's time to sync your commit back to GitHub. Say `git push origin master`. Go to your repo's webpage on GitHub and refresh it. See your rhymes?

3. **Learner B and C**: Clone Learner A's repo. Show Learner A the local files that you got from cloning. Show Learner A a `git log` on your clone. The commit message is there, too!

4. **Learner B and C**: High five Learner A. (And Matt and Joe. They love that.)
