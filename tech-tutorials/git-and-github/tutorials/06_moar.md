# Interesting Stuff To Do

If you're familar with git already, do two things:

1. Set up a repo and share it with your collaborators. Practice creating branches, and then submitting pull requests to `master` for your changes. Somebody else should approve and merge your changes. Rotate, so that everybody in your group gets to approve somebody else pull request.

2. Individually, do this [awesome tutorials](http://learngitbranching.js.org/).
